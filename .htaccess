RewriteEngine On

# generic: ?var=value
# you can retrieve /something by looking at $_GET['something']
RewriteRule ^(.+)$ /?var=$1

# but depending on your current links, you might
# need to map everything out. Examples:

# /users/1
# to: ?p=users&userId=1
RewriteRule ^view/([0-9]+)$ /view.php?i=$1

# /articles/123/asc
# to: ?p=articles&show=123&sort=asc
RewriteRule ^articles/([0-9]+)/(asc|desc)$ /?p=articles&show=$1&sort=$2

# you can add /? at the end to make a trailing slash work as well:
# /something or /something/
# to: ?var=something
RewriteRule ^(.+)/?$ /?var=$1
